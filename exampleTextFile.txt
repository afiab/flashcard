Question: What is the central dogma of molecular biology?
Answer: The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system.
Question: What are the three main processes in the central dogma?
Answer: The three main processes are DNA replication, transcription, and translation.
Question: Explain DNA replication.
Answer: DNA replication is the process by which a cell makes an exact copy of its DNA. It occurs during cell division and ensures that each daughter cell receives an identical set of genetic instructions.
Question: What is transcription?
Answer: Transcription is the process of copying the information stored in DNA into a molecule called RNA. This RNA molecule, known as messenger RNA (mRNA), carries the genetic code from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
Question: What happens during translation?
Answer: Translation is the process in which the genetic information carried by mRNA is used to assemble proteins. It occurs at the ribosomes and involves the conversion of the mRNA code into a specific sequence of amino acids to build a protein.
Question: What are the building blocks of proteins?
Answer: Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 different amino acids commonly found in living organisms, each with a unique chemical structure and properties.
Question: What is the role of enzymes in biological reactions?
Answer: Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They lower the activation energy required for reactions to occur, making them essential for many cellular processes.
Question: What is mitosis?
Answer: Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It is responsible for growth, tissue repair, and asexual reproduction in multicellular organisms.
Question: What is meiosis?
Answer: Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms. It reduces the chromosome number by half and results in the formation of haploid gametes (sperm and egg cells) with genetic diversity.
Question: What is the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
Answer: Prokaryotic cells lack a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have a defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotes are typically single-celled organisms, whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular.
